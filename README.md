# MNIST Classification Project

This project trains a CNN model on the MNIST dataset to achieve a target accuracy of 99.4% in 15 epochs or less.

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the model architecture.
- `train.py`: Handles the training process.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions (currently empty).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore in version control.

## Instructions

1. Install the required packages:   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```

2. Run the training script:   ```bash
   python train.py   ```

3. Monitor the logs to ensure the target accuracy is achieved.

## Target, Result, Analysis

- **Target**: Achieve 99.4% accuracy in 15 epochs or less with a model having <= 8000 parameters.
- **Result**: [To be filled after training]
- **Analysis**: [To be filled after training]
